# Mockingbird

**Mockingbird** is a **N**etwork **A**bstraction **L**ayer *(NAL)* written in swift leveraging the power and versatility of *Foundation's* **URLSession**. It's compatible with **iOS** version *9* or greater and **macOS** version *10.12* or greater.

It draws inspiration from [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) and [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) with a focus in easier integration and unit testing of the network layer.
